# brp-identity
Small script to allow users to show an ID to nearby players based on proximity. This was not originally made to be public and there is no guarantee it will work for your server.

## Requirements
1. Working ESX Server
2. Basic programming knowledge

## Setup
1. Create an item in your database called `citizen-card`
2. Add `brp-identity` to your server config

### Support
If you have issues please put it in the Issues section and I will attempt to fix it. I do not intend to provide any support for the resource as it should be plug and play.
